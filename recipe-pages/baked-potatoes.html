                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="outfit">
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 450F.</li>
                    <li>Wash off your potatoes very well. Make sure you really scrub that dirt out with your hands.</li>
                    <li>Stab your potatoes with a fork multiple times on all sides. Take our your anger is needed. This is so they don't literally explode on you so it's kinda important.</li>
                    <li>While your potatoes are still wet (do not dry them) put some salt onto your hand and srub it all over the potato. This will give it a nice salty crust. You need not be afraid of the sodium. You only live once.</li>
                    <li>Place your potatoes into the over for 60 minutes or until they reach an internal tempurature of 205F-210F if you want to be fancy.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, pull them out of the oven and place them in some form of bakable container. I just a glass dish thingy. Coat them with olive oil but be sure not to drown them it.</li>
                    <li>Throw them back in the oven for 10 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>You're done! Plate them and serve. Be sure to cut a slit in them fairly quickly once they're out of the oven so they don't continue to cook.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Notes</h3>
                <p class="outfit">Dressing them up with some of the optional ingredients is not necessary but highly recommended if you don't want to look like a weirdo. But if you're chill with being a weirdo then go right ahead, I can't really judge.</p>
