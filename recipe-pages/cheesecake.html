                <ol class="outfit">
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350F.</li>
                    <li>Throw some graham crackers into a ziplock bag and crush them up. Personally, I use a rolling pin to beat them up.</li>
                    <li>Melt your butter and mix it into the graham cracker crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9in springform pan. Make sure it's even!</li>
                    <li>One at a time, beat your creamcheese in either a large bowl or a kitchen aid mixer. Your choice with that.</li>
                    <li>Throw your sugar in with the cream cheese and beat some more.</li>
                    <li>One at a time, beat in the eggs. It is very important for it to be one at a time. Scrape down the sides in between each egg.</li>
                    <li>Add in your vanilla extract and beat one last time.</li>
                    <li>Add the mixture into the springform pan and bake it for 35-45 minutes or until it's a little bit browned on top. Be sure not to cook it too long.</li>
                    <li>Let it cool COMPLETELY before serving. It should be left in the fridge for at least 4 hours if not more.</li>
                    <li>You're done!</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Notes</h3>
                <p class="outfit">If you make it right you'll get a ton of compliments and be very confused because it's so easy yet so many people are impressed.</p>
                <p class="outfit">People act like it's a crime for your cheesecake to crack but really it's no big deal. It tastes the same in the end. Be proud if you can get it not to crack though!</p>
                <p class="outfit">Please for the love of god serve this with whipped cream, cheesecake is always better with whipped cream.</p>
