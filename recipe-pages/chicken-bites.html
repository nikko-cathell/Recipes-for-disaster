                    <li>At least one chicken thigh, depends on how much you want</li>
                    <li>1tbsp canola/vegetable oil (do not use olive oil)</li>
                    <li>1tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>Seasonings of your choosing, preferably matching seasonings of whatever you're pairing these with</li>

                <ol class="outfit">
                    <li>Cut up your chicken thigh(s) into about 1in cubes. If you'd like to make them a different size that's cool too though.</li>
                    <li>Throw your cut up chicken into a big bowl and put in your seasonings. Toss it all together until all the chicken is covered.</li>
                    <li>Heat up a pan/skillet to medium high heat and melt your butter and oil together.</li>
                    <li>Once that's heated, put your chicken in and let it cook until everything is good and browned. Make sure you're occasionally stirring it and flipping the chicken over to get all the sides cooked. This will probably take somewhere around 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Take a large piece and cut it in half to check if it's all cooked. If it needs more time, put it right back in. No risking salmonella on my watch on my recipe page that I programmed for your convenience. I won't be having any of that.</li>
                    <li>Easy as that, you're done! Now you just combine the chicken into whatever you're pairing it with.</li>
                </ol>
