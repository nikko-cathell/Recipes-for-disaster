                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="outfit">
                    <li>Heat up some water (seems to be recommended to salt the water) and boil your pasta for the appropriate time. Check the packaging to find out what that is. Once that's done drain it and set it to the side.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a large pan/skillet over medium heat melt the butter then add your minced garlic and saute until it smells really good (about a minute).</li>
                    <li>Next, sprinkle the four over the garlic mixture and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to ensure the flour cooks and makes a nice, smooth paste.</li>
                    <li>Now you gradually pour in the milk and cream, whisking constantly to prevent it from getting all lumpy bumpy. Cook that for about 3-4 minutes until it thickens a little.</li>
                    <li>Time for the seasoning! Add all the seasonings, including the cheese (that's a seasoning if you ask me) and cook for a minute or two until the cheese is good and melted.</li>
                    <li>Mix it all together now. Put the pasta right on in there and give it a good stir to make sure it all gets good and covered. If you're adding chicken bites, this is when you'd also throw those in there.</li>
                    <li>Turn off all the heat and be sure to take the pan off the hot burner.</li>
                    <li>You're done! Plate and garnish with basil and/or parsley. Or don't it's your life not mine.</li>
                </ol>
