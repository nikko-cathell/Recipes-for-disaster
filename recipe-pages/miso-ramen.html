                <ol class="outfit">
                    <li>Start by boiling your ramen noodles for the appropriate amount of time in a pot. As they boil, add in your miso paste. An optional way of doing that is waiting until your noodles are done, then dumping the water into your bowl and adding your miso in there. Whatever is easiest for you and your memory.</li>
                    <li>While that's boiling, in a separate pot (or pan) boil your eggs. You will want to boil them until they're poached. However you'd like your yolk texture is up to you. (Find egg boiling technique in notes)</li>
                    <li>Put the ramen in a bowl and add your flavor packet of choice. Chicken, beef, or pork bouillon works just as well.</li>
                    <li>Mix and optionally add meats or vegetables of choice. You're done. Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="notes">
                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Notes</h3>
                <p class="outfit">To poach an egg the easy way, add water into a pot (or pan) and let it boil. Once it's boiled, crack your egg into the pot and let it boil for 2 - 2.5 minutes.</p>
                <p class="outfit">Any vegetables added can simply be cooked the way you normally would or by any directions on a package.</p>
                <p class="outfit">For your meats (I prefer pork belly), you will fry it on a skillet and then add it to your ramen once everything is completed.</p>
