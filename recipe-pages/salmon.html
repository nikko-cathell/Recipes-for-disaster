                    <li>At least one piece of salmon, preferably from aldi's (their salmon is the only salmon)</li>
                    <li>2tbsp canola/vegetable oil (do not use olive oil)</li>
                    <li>2tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Pepper</li>
                    <li>Creole seasoning (trust)</li>

                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="outfit">
                    <li>Put an appropriately sized pan on the stove at medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Throw your oil and butter in the pan while it heats, move to step 3 in the meantime.</li>
                    <li>Season the salmon with all seasonings listed. Don't hold back but don't go overboard either. Listen to your ancestors or local spirits if available/applicable for advice.</li>
                    <li>Once the oils are bubbling begin cooking the salmon flesh side down. There is no exact timing, it depends on the piece, but listen to your heart. You'll know it's cooked when it's good and browned on top, it's ok to have to flip it back over to cook for longer. The average cook time is 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Once your gut says it's time, flip that salmon over and let it cook some more. Same thing, it depends on the salmon for the timing but the skin will be nice and crispy when it's done.</li>
                    <li>Plate and serve, You're done!</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="chau-philomene-one-regular">Notes</h3>
                <p class="outfit">If both sides are cooked to your liking but the middle is still pink, don't worry! People say not to put fish in the microwave but you're going to go right on ahead and ignore that rule. Put it in for 30s-1m and it should be good to go. If it's still a bit pink that's fine, leave it be, if you cook it any longer it'll get chewy and nobody likes chewy fish.</p>
                <p class="outfit">The best sides for this sensational salmon are fries or rice if your like you life to be full of fun and whimsey.</p>
                <p class="outfit">Vegetables can suffice if your life is not full of fun and whimsey.</p>
